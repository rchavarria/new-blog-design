Exploring new designs for the blog

# Designs

- [Jekflix](http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/jekflix/): it seems nice for book and courses reviews
- [NeXT](http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/jekyll-theme-next/): it seems nice for the blog itself, very minimalistic
- [Hagura](http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/hagura/): nice for the blog too. simple but with some details
- [Hydeout](http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/hydeout/): it looks nice for the blog too, with a side panel. but, it seems oldish
